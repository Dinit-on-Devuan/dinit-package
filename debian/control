Description: Service monitoring / "init" system
 Dinit is a service supervisor with dependency support
 which can also act as the system "init" program.
 It was created with the intention of providing a portable
 init system with dependency management, that was functionally
 superior to many extant inits. Development goals include
 clean design, robustness, portability, usability,
 and avoiding feature bloat (whilst still handling
 common - and some less-common - use cases).
 Dinit is designed to integrate with rather than subsume or replace
 other system software.
